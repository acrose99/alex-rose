For design, I use Figma to prototype and create wireframes, and then (obviously) use CSS on the actual site.

I also have a lot of experience with design systems. I like Material Design, but my new favorite is the [Chicago Design System](https://design.chicago.gov/), which I used in [Foodspector](https://acrose99.github.io/Foodspector/),  and made my own (WIP) system for the History of Computing project, which you can see [here](https://github.com/acrose99/HistoryOfComputingDocs).
