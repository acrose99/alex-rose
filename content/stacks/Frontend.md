In regard to the real code, I primarily use vanilla Javascript or Typescript. I prefer to use Typescript when possible.

In terms of Frameworks, I am proficient with React and Svelte. I am intermediate with Vue though I prefer the aforementioned frameworks. 

I’m also well versed in creating accessible sites using A11Y.

Finally, I'm OK at React Native, although I haven't used it for a major project.
