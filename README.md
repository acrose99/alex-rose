This is my source code for my site. See the link on the sidebar for the live site.

## About the code

I am  using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the frontend and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) for the backend/hosting.

I dynamically render much of the site using Markdown and JSON.

The structure is based off the default [Sapper Template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template-rollup). See the full details and instruction there.

## Running Locally

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm dev`
